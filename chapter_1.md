# Chapter 1: The Drop - Script Outline

**Objective:** Introduce the player to the world, core survival mechanics, the AI, and the first major event. The player must acquire their first Data Fragment and activate the Archive Gate.

---

### **SCENE 1: IMPACT**

* **LOCATION:** Drop Pod, moments before landing.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player.
* **SUMMARY:** The chapter opens with the player confined and disoriented inside a drop pod during a violent atmospheric re-entry. They witness the shattered planet through a viewport before the pod crashes, knocking them unconscious.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:** None. This scene is a non-interactive cinematic to establish the tone and setting.
* **OUTCOME:** The player blacks out. Leads to Scene 2.

---

### **SCENE 2: AWAKENING**

* **LOCATION:** Ruined Maintenance Bay (The first room).
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, The AI (voice).
* **SUMMARY:** The player awakens to the AI implant activating in their head. The drop pod door opens, revealing the bay. The AI provides location data ("Test Site Echo-7," "Ruined City-Isle"). The player must choose a character, which sets their base stats.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:**
    1.  Select a character (Kaelen, Aris, or Lena).
* **OUTCOME:** Base stats are set. The player is now in control and can explore the room. Leads to Scene 3.

---

### **SCENE 3: THE FIRST ROOM**

* **LOCATION:** Ruined Maintenance Bay.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, The AI.
* **SUMMARY:** The player explores the starting room, which contains a rusted locker and a patch of Glimmer Moss. This scene serves as a tutorial for basic skill checks and resource gathering.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:**
    1.  **Investigate the Locker:** A skill check is required (Strength to force, Agility to pick, or Intelligence to hotwire).
    2.  **Investigate the Moss:** A skill check is required (Perception to notice details, Aris's Bio-Scan for full analysis).
    3.  **Query the AI:** Interact with the AI for more lore/context.
    4.  **Leave the room.**
* **OUTCOME:** The player potentially gains their first resources (**Degraded Power Cell**, **Glimmer Moss Sample**). After exploring, they proceed through the collapsed doorway. Leads to Scene 4.

---

### **SCENE 4: THE FIRST OBSTACLE**

* **LOCATION:** A collapsed transit tunnel connecting the Maintenance Bay to the Plaza.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player.
* **SUMMARY:** To reach the plaza, the player must navigate a short but unstable tunnel. The floor is a mess of twisted metal and rubble, and the ceiling groans under the strain. This is a mandatory challenge to proceed.
* **PLAYER CHOICE (All characters see all options):**
    1.  **[BRUTE FORCE]:** Shove a large piece of debris to create a stable, direct path.
    2.  **[ANALYZE]:** Scan the structure for the most stable route and reinforce a weak point with scrap metal.
    3.  **[NAVIGATE]:** Nimbly climb and weave through the most dangerous, but quickest, path.
* **OUTCOME:**
    * **SUCCESS (Choosing the correct option for your character):**
        * If you are **Kaelen** and choose **[BRUTE FORCE]**...
        * If you are **Aris** and choose **[ANALYZE]**...
        * If you are **Lena** and choose **[NAVIGATE]**...
        * ...you succeed. You use your natural talents to pass through the tunnel unharmed, all attributes intact.
    * **FAILURE (Choosing the incorrect option for your character):**
        * If you are Kaelen and choose to Analyze, or Lena and choose Brute Force, etc...
        * ...your attempt is clumsy and ill-suited to your skills. A piece of rubble gives way, and you get through, but you are injured or exhausted. You receive a temporary debuff or a minor permanent reduction (e.g., -1) to the attribute you tried to use (Strength for Brute Force, Intelligence for Analyze, or Agility for Navigate). This will make the skill check in Scene 5A more difficult.
    * Leads to Scene 5.

---

### **SCENE 5: THE CROSSROADS & THE ANNOUNCEMENT**

* **LOCATION:** A ruined city plaza outside the transit tunnel.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, The Proctor (voice).
* **SUMMARY:** The player emerges into a larger area with two clear paths. A high-Perception character may notice tracks. The Proctor's booming voice announces the **Major Event: The Drop**, a time-limited supply cache landing in the plaza.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:**
    1.  **Go for the Supply Drop:** Head towards the contested location.
    2.  **Ignore the Drop:** Choose a path (rooftops or subway) to avoid the conflict.
* **OUTCOME:** Leads to either **Scene 5A** (Go for Drop) or **Scene 6** (Ignore Drop).

---

### **SCENE 5A: THE CACHE**

* **LOCATION:** Central Plaza, beside a smoking crater where a large, metallic crate is half-buried in the ground.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, their Rival (Xander, Isha, or Jinx).
* **SUMMARY:** The player approaches the supply cache. Their Rival is already there, having just forced the main lock. They look up as the player approaches, a possessive glint in their eyes. The air is thick with tension.

* **PLAYER CHOICE (If Kaelen vs. Xander):**
    * Xander is kicking at a secondary lock on the crate. He smirks. "Look what the drop pod dragged in. Little late to the party, Rook. I've already claimed this prize."
    * **1. [CONFRONT - Strength Check]:** "You've claimed nothing. Step aside, Xander."
        * **SUCCESS:** Kaelen's raw, imposing presence gives Xander pause. Xander sizes him up and scoffs, "Fine. You can have the scraps." He kicks the crate, popping open the main compartment, but a smaller, secondary compartment remains locked. Xander walks away with a sneer, having taken something, but the main prize is Kaelen's. **(Outcome: Kaelen acquires the Kinetic Field Emitter).**
        * **FAILURE (Especially if debuffed from Scene 4):** Kaelen's exhaustion shows. Xander laughs. "You look weak, Rook." A brief, brutal scuffle ensues. Kaelen is shoved back, and Xander manages to break the secondary lock, grabbing the Kinetic Field Emitter before retreating. "Always a step behind," he taunts. **(Outcome: Kaelen gets minor supplies, Rival gets the Emitter).**
    * **2. [WITHDRAW]:** "Keep it. It's probably trapped."
        * **OUTCOME:** Kaelen backs away. Xander watches him go with a look of contemptuous victory. Kaelen is safe, but has given a powerful tool to his worst enemy. **(Outcome: No supplies, Rival gets the Emitter).**

* **PLAYER CHOICE (If Aris vs. Jinx):**
    * Jinx is tinkering with the crate's lock, sparks flying from a jury-rigged device. She grins maniacally. "Ooh, a new lab rat! Come to see the light show? I'm about to give this thing a little... percussive maintenance."
    * **1. [DECEIVE - Intelligence Check]:** "Stop! That's an Archivist thermal-sync lock. One more spark and you'll flash-fry everything in a 20-meter radius. Let me bypass the core."
        * **SUCCESS:** Aris's confident, technical jargon makes Jinx hesitate, intrigued. "Ooh, dangerous! I like it." She lets him work. Aris "bypasses" the core, but actually rewires it to a secondary latch, popping it open silently. He grabs the Kinetic Field Emitter from inside and makes a run for it before Jinx realizes she's been tricked.
        * **FAILURE (Especially if debuffed from Scene 4):** Jinx sees a flaw in Aris's technobabble. "Nice try, lab coat, but you forgot to account for the secondary capacitor!" She triggers her device. A localized EMP blast shorts out Aris's AI map for a minute and pops the crate open. Jinx cackles, grabs the Emitter, and vanishes into the ruins.
    * **2. [WITHDRAW]:** "You're insane. It's all yours."
        * **OUTCOME:** Aris backs away slowly. Jinx doesn't even seem to notice, too engrossed in her work. A moment later, a small explosion is heard. Aris is safe, but Jinx now has a new, powerful toy.

* **PLAYER CHOICE (If Lena vs. Isha):**
    * Isha is calmly examining the crate's lock, her movements patient and precise. She doesn't turn, but speaks in a low voice. "I heard you five minutes ago. The wind carried the sound of your boots on the concrete. Come out where I can see you."
    * **1. [INFILTRATE - Agility Check]:** (From hiding) Create a diversion to draw her away.
        * **SUCCESS:** Lena, realizing she's been spotted, uses it to her advantage. She throws a rock far to the left, but simultaneously circles around to the right. Isha's head tracks the sound, but Lena's silent movement allows her to reach the crate from the blind spot, pop the emergency latch, and grab the Kinetic Field Emitter before Isha can reacquire her target.
        * **FAILURE (Especially if debuffed from Scene 4):** Lena's movement is not silent enough. As she reaches for the crate, an arrow whistles past her ear, embedding itself in the metal. "Too slow," Isha says. A tense chase ensues, forcing Lena to retreat empty-handed.
    * **2. [REVEAL SELF]:** Step out from the shadows. "I'm not here for a fight. Just a look."
        * **OUTCOME:** Isha finally turns, a predatory smile on her face. "A look is all you'll get." She expertly opens the crate, takes the Emitter, and gives Lena a final nod. "Now you know what I have. Run." It's a warning and a promise. The hunt has begun.

* **OUTCOME:**
    * The player's success or failure determines who gets the **Kinetic Field Emitter**, a powerful tool that will impact future encounters.
    * This scene solidifies the hostile relationship with their Rival.
    * The player now proceeds to **Scene 6** to continue the hunt for Data Fragments.

---

### **SCENE 6: THE FIRST TEST**

* **SUMMARY:** After dealing with (or avoiding) the supply drop, the player proceeds down their chosen path. They soon encounter their first mandatory "Test Chamber," a controlled environment where the AI informs them a Data Fragment can be earned. The nature of the test is determined by the path chosen.

---

### **PATH A - SCENE 6A: THE ROOFTOPS TEST (TRAVERSAL)**

* **LOCATION:** The base of a massive, dilapidated communications tower clinging to the side of a skyscraper.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, The AI.
* **SUMMARY:** The player follows the treacherous rooftop path to the base of a huge comms tower. The AI's voice chimes in: *"Archivist Test Chamber detected. Objective: Retrieve Data Fragment from the tower's broadcast antenna. Warning: Structural integrity is compromised. A time limit is advised."* The player must make a difficult and dangerous climb.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:**
    1.  **[Begin the Climb - Agility Check]:** The player starts their ascent, navigating broken ladders, exposed rebar, and gusting winds.
* **OUTCOME:**
    * **SUCCESS (High Agility):** The character moves with grace and speed, easily navigating the hazards. Lena would excel here, feeling right at home. They retrieve the **first Data Fragment** from the antenna array at the top with time to spare.
    * **PARTIAL SUCCESS (Moderate Agility/Strength):** The character struggles but makes it. Kaelen might use his raw strength to power through a difficult section, while Aris might struggle significantly. They retrieve the fragment but are exhausted, possibly suffering a temporary "Fatigued" debuff to their physical stats.
    * **FAILURE (Low Agility):** A handhold crumbles or a gust of wind throws them off balance. They fall a short distance, taking damage, and fail to reach the top. The AI's voice notes, *"Subject has failed the test. Data Fragment unretrievable."* The player must now find an alternative, more difficult path to acquire their first fragment.
    * Regardless of the outcome, the player proceeds to **Scene 8**.

---

### **PATH B - SCENE 6B: THE SUBWAY TEST (COMBAT/STEALTH)**

* **LOCATION:** A flooded subway station platform, lit by the green glow of moss.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, The AI, a Slick-Skinned Skulker.
* **SUMMARY:** The player wades through the dark tunnels to a station platform. In the center is a functioning Archivist terminal, humming with power. The AI's voice chimes in: *"Archivist Test Chamber detected. Objective: Access the terminal to download one Data Fragment."* A single, powerful Slick-Skinned Skulker is guarding the terminal, its head twitching at every sound.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:**
    1.  **[Engage the Skulker - Strength Check]:** "Time to take out the trash."
    2.  **[Sneak to the Terminal - Agility Check]:** "I can get past it without a sound."
    3.  **[Analyze the Environment - Intelligence Check]:** "There has to be a smarter way."
* **OUTCOME:**
    * **SUCCESS (Strength):** The character, likely Kaelen, engages the creature in a brutal fight and defeats it, clearing the way to the terminal.
    * **SUCCESS (Agility):** The character, likely Lena, uses the shadows and the sound of dripping water to slip past the creature unnoticed and access the terminal.
    * **SUCCESS (Intelligence):** The character, likely Aris, notices a sparking power conduit hanging over a puddle near the Skulker. A well-aimed piece of scrap metal can cause it to fall, electrocuting and neutralizing the creature from a safe distance.
    * **FAILURE:** A failed check results in a vicious fight. The player takes damage and is forced to retreat, failing the test. The AI notes, *"Subject has failed the test. Data Fragment unretrievable."* The player must now find an alternative, more difficult path.
    * On success, the player downloads the **first Data Fragment**. Regardless of the outcome, they proceed to **Scene 8**.

---

### **SCENE 7: THE FRAGMENT**

* **LOCATION:** Same as the completed test (Rooftops or Subway).
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, The AI.
* **SUMMARY:** The player retrieves the Data Fragment. It's a small, crystalline object that hums with a faint energy. The AI's voice chimes in their head as they inspect it.
* **PLAYER CHOICE (Dialogue choices based on character):**

    * **If Kaelen:**
        * The AI states: *"First Data Fragment acquired. Two remaining."*
        * **1. "Cut the chatter. Where's the next one?"**
            * *AI: "Triangulating... Energy signatures are inconsistent. Further data is required to pinpoint the next fragment's exact location."*
        * **2. "What is this thing, really?"**
            * *AI: "A data key. It contains positioning algorithms. Useless individually, but invaluable when combined."*

    * **If Aris:**
        * The AI states: *"First Data Fragment acquired. Analysis suggests it is a complex bio-organic data storage medium."*
        * **1. "Fascinating. Is the crystalline structure naturally occurring?"**
            * *AI: "Negative. It is a manufactured lattice, grown around a quantum processing core. The technology is far beyond your civilization's understanding."*
        * **2. "So these 'fragments' are the keys to progression?"**
            * *AI: "A logical deduction. Mastery of the environment is the metric for success. Acquiring all fragments is the primary indicator of mastery for this phase."*

    * **If Lena:**
        * The AI states: *"First Data Fragment acquired. Be advised, its energy signature may be detectable by other subjects."*
        * **1. "Can I mask the signature?"**
            * *AI: "Possible, with the correct dampening materials. However, such materials are not currently in your possession."*
        * **2. "What aren't you telling me about these things?"**
            * *AI: "My function is to provide necessary data for the experiment. The purpose of the experiment itself is data available only to the Proctor."*

* **OUTCOME:** The player now understands their primary goal is to find two more fragments. The AI directs them towards a general energy signature for the next fragment. **Leads to Scene 8.**

---

### **SCENE 8: THE BARGAIN**

* **LOCATION:** A dilapidated hab-block, lit by a single emergency light. Rain streaks down a grimy window.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, Jedediah "Jed".
* **SUMMARY:** The AI directs the player toward a faint energy signature. Inside a small, ruined apartment, they find Jed. He's an older, weathered man, slumped against a wall with a makeshift splint on his leg. He has a Data Fragment clutched in his hand, but his canteen is empty and lying on its side. He looks up at the player, not with fear, but with weary resignation.

* **Jed's Opening Dialogue:** "Well, look what the cat dragged in. Don't worry, I'm not looking for a fight. Leg's busted. All I need is a canteen of clean water. This place is picked clean. You bring me some water, and this shiny little doodad is all yours. I can't get to the Gate like this anyway."

* **PLAYER CHOICE (Character-Dependent):**

    * **If Kaelen:**
        * **1. [HELP - Endurance Check]:** "Stay put. I'll find you some water."
            * **Outcome:** Kaelen finds a nearby water source but must fend off a few Skulkers attracted to the area. He returns, battered but successful. Jed gives him the fragment and a nod of respect.
            * **Consequence Flag:** `Jed_Helped` set. Jed is now a potential ally.

        * **2. [INTIMIDATE - Strength Check]:** "The fragment. Now. Or we see how that other leg holds up."
            * **Outcome:** Kaelen's threat is palpable. Jed, seeing no other option, tosses him the fragment with a look of pure contempt. "You're just like the others," he mutters.
            * **Consequence Flag:** `Jed_Hostile` set. Jed will remember this and may actively work against the player later.

        * **3. [ATTACK]:** (Say nothing and attack him.)
            * **Outcome:** Jed is in no condition to fight back. Kaelen takes the fragment from his body. The AI's voice is cold and flat in his mind: *"Subject neutralized. A logical, if predictable, outcome."*
            * **Consequence Flag:** `Jed_Dead` set.

    * **If Aris:**
        * **1. [HELP - Intelligence Check]:** "Your splint is inadequate. I can craft a proper medical brace, and I have water purification tablets. Let's make a deal."
            * **Outcome:** Aris uses his technical skill to craft a high-quality brace for Jed's leg. In return, Jed gratefully hands over the fragment and a piece of useful lore about the local flora.
            * **Consequence Flag:** `Jed_Helped` set. Jed is now a potential ally with high respect for Aris's skills.

        * **2. [DECEIVE - Intelligence Check]:** "I have a powerful healing salve. Let me apply it. But I'll need to hold the fragment while I work, as a show of good faith."
            * **Outcome:** Aris applies a useless poultice of crushed leaves. While Jed is distracted by the placebo, Aris pockets the fragment and slips away. Jed's curses follow him down the corridor.
            * **Consequence Flag:** `Jed_Hostile` set. Jed will remember being outsmarted and will be wary of the player's tricks in the future.

        * **3. [ATTACK]:** (Use a crafted poison or trap.)
            * **Outcome:** Aris uses his knowledge to neutralize Jed without a direct fight. He retrieves the fragment. The AI notes, *"Subject neutralized. An efficient application of available resources."*
            * **Consequence Flag:** `Jed_Dead` set.

    * **If Lena:**
        * **1. [HELP - Perception Check]:** "I'll get your water. But I'm scouting the area first."
            * **Outcome:** Lena's sharp eyes spot a hidden rainwater collector on a nearby balcony that others would have missed. She retrieves the water safely and quickly. Jed is impressed by her efficiency and gives her the fragment, plus a tip about a hidden route.
            * **Consequence Flag:** `Jed_Helped` set. Jed is now a potential ally who sees Lena as a reliable survivor.

        * **2. [STEAL - Agility Check]:** "Look out!" (Create a diversion and attempt to snatch the fragment).
            * **Outcome:** Lena points to the window, yelling a warning. As Jed's head whips around, she uses her speed to snatch the fragment from his hand and dart out of the room before he can react.
            * **Consequence Flag:** `Jed_Hostile` set. Jed will remember Lena's speed and ruthlessness.

        * **3. [ATTACK]:** (Use a stealth attack.)
            * **Outcome:** Lena slips into the shadows and neutralizes Jed before he knows what's happening. She takes the fragment. The AI comments, *"Subject neutralized. Minimal energy expenditure. Optimal."*
            * **Consequence Flag:** `Jed_Dead` set.

* **OUTCOME:** The player acquires the **second Data Fragment** and sets a critical story flag that will shape the narrative of Chapter 2 and beyond. Leads to Scene 7.

---

### **SCENE 9: THE PURGE PROTOCOL**

* **LOCATION:** Anywhere in the Verdant Ruin.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, The Proctor.
* **SUMMARY:** This scene triggers if the "Phase 1" timer runs out (e.g., after 10 cycles) and the player has not acquired all three Data Fragments. Red emergency lights flash across the zone, and a blaring alarm sounds. The Proctor's voice echoes everywhere, cold and final.
* **Proctor's Dialogue:** *"Phase One has concluded. Subject has failed to demonstrate adequate mastery of the environment. Specimen is deemed... substandard. Initiating sanitation protocol. Purge drone activated. Good luck."*
* **PLAYER CHOICE:** None. This is a reactive, high-stakes survival sequence.
* **OUTCOME:**
    * A powerful, elite security drone (or another designated "purger" creature) is released into the zone with one objective: hunt and terminate the player.
    * This is not a winnable fight. The player's new objective is to flee and find an emergency exit (e.g., a maintenance conduit, a garbage chute) to escape the zone.
    * **SUCCESSFUL ESCAPE:** The player escapes the zone but with a significant penalty. They start Chapter 2 in a disadvantageous location, possibly injured, and without the benefit of any gear or lore they would have gained by activating the Archive Gate.
    * **FAILURE TO ESCAPE:** The player is cornered and terminated by the purge unit. This results in a specific **GAME OVER** screen that highlights their failure to meet the Archivists' standards.

---

### **SCENE 10: THE LAIR**

* **LOCATION:** A heavily defended nest.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, Alpha Skulker Matriarch.
* **SUMMARY:** The player finds the third Data Fragment in the nest of the zone's Apex Predator.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:** Direct assault, environmental sabotage, or stealth infiltration.
* **OUTCOME:** Player acquires the **third and final Data Fragment**. Leads to Scene 9.

---

### **SCENE 11: THE GATE**

* **LOCATION:** A hidden, ancient-looking part of the ruins.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, The AI.
* **SUMMARY:** With all fragments, the AI reveals the location of the Archive Gate. The player activates it.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:** Step through the Gate.
* **OUTCOME:** The player is transported to the next zone, the Ash-Fall Isles. Chapter 1 concludes successfully.
