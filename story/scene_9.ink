=== find_jed_for_fragment ===
Inside, you find an older, weathered man slumped against a wall with a makeshift splint on his leg. He has a Data Fragment clutched in his hand, but his face is pale with pain. This must be Jed.
He looks up at you, not with fear, but with weary resignation. "Well, look what the cat dragged in," he rasps. "Don't suppose you've got a working power cell on you? This old diagnostic tool is dead, and I need to see how bad this leg is." He gestures to the fragment. "It's yours if you can help."

* { power_cell_stack > 0 } [Trade a Power Cell for the fragment.]
    You nod, pulling a Degraded Power Cell from your pack. Jed's eyes light up with relief. "Thank you, friend. A deal's a deal." He tosses you the fragment.

    You lunge at the old man, deciding to take the fragment by force. Jed isn't surprised. With a weary sigh, he pulls a hidden trigger on the floor.
    ~ temp trap_roll = RANDOM(1, 10)
    { trap_roll == 1:
        // RARE SUCCESS (10% chance)
        You see the trap mechanism a split second before it springsâ€”a powerful stun baton swinging out from a wall panel. You manage to dodge it. Jed looks genuinely surprised. You snatch the fragment from his hand before he can react further.

        A powerful stun baton swings out from a hidden wall panel, slamming into your side with a crackle of electricity. The shock is immense, leaving you gasping on the floor as your vision whites out.

            You drag yourself out of the room, empty-handed and in agony.

As you head for the collapsed doorway, a voice calls out from the shadows. "Hold on a minute, friend." Jed limps towards you, leaning on a makeshift crutch.

"You did me a real kindness back there," he says, his eyes grateful. "Most folks in this place would've just put a knife in my back. The Arena... it changes people."

He holds out a slightly damaged datapad. "I've been here a while. Found a few of these logs and cracked 'em. Nothing that'll tell you how to win, but... it helps to know what you're up against. You should have them."

You take the datapad. He's unlocked several entries for you.
