The second floor is a cramped server room. A hulking figure, the "Brute," blocks the only doorway, cracking their knuckles. "Tower's mine," they grunt. "Get lost or get broken." This will be a fight.

=== tower_floor_3 ===
After defeating the Brute, you ascend to the third floor, a darkened observation deck. You don't see anyone, but your instincts scream "trap."

A shadowy figure, the "Ghost," curses from the far side of the room and flees upwards.
    - else:
        // Failure
        You step forward and a trap springs! A heavy cargo net drops from the ceiling, entangling you. It takes you precious moments to cut yourself free. You've lost time, and the Ghost is long gone.

The fourth floor is a chaotic workshop, filled with sparking contraptions. A contestant in a customized tech-suit, the "Tinkerer," is working on a device. "Ah, a new test subject!" they exclaim, leveling a whirring gadget at you.

=== tower_floor_5 ===
You reach the final floor before the spire's peak. A contestant with cold, professional eyes, the "Veteran," stands waiting for you. They hold a sharpened piece of rebar like a short sword. "Only one of us gets that fragment," they say calmly. "Let's make this quick."

Panting and bruised, you finally reach the open-air platform at the peak of the tower. The emergency light flashes on the console where the **second Data Fragment** is waiting. You take it.

// === SCENE 8B: THE DESCENT ===
=== descend_from_tower ===
You stand at the apex of the spire, the wind whipping at your clothes. For a moment, you can see the shattered world in its entiretyâ€”a graveyard of floating islands hanging in the green-tinged void. The climb was brutal, but the way down looks easier. You spot what looks like a functioning service lift on a lower level.

The descent is quiet and jarringly peaceful after the chaos of the climb. The lift carries you down into the heart of the ruined hab-block district that surrounds the tower's base. These crumbling residential buildings are a maze of collapsed corridors and dark, empty homes.

Your AI pings a location nearby. <i>AI: "Life sign detected. Biorhythms indicate stress and injury, but subject is not hostile."</i>

Following the signal, you navigate the treacherous streets until you come across a small, fortified room in one of the less damaged hab-blocks. The door is slightly ajar, and you can see a dim light from within. It seems recently occupied.

// === SCENE 8A: TOWER BUFFER ROOM ===

You find a small, cramped access corridor between the floors. The sounds of combat have faded, giving you a brief moment to recover before ascending further.

        You stretch your aching muscles and take a long drink of water. The weariness recedes, and you feel ready to continue.
