---

### **SCENE 1: IMPACT**

* **LOCATION:** Drop Pod, moments before landing.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player.
* **SUMMARY:** The chapter opens with the player confined and disoriented inside a drop pod during a violent atmospheric re-entry. They witness the shattered planet through a viewport before the pod crashes, knocking them unconscious.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:** None. This scene is a non-interactive cinematic to establish the tone and setting.
* **OUTCOME:** The player blacks out. Leads to Scene 2.

---

### **SCENE 2: AWAKENING**

* **LOCATION:** Ruined Maintenance Bay (The first room).
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, The AI (voice).
* **SUMMARY:** The player awakens to the AI implant activating in their head. The drop pod door opens, revealing the bay. The AI provides location data ("Test Site Echo-7," "Ruined City-Isle"). The player must choose a character, which sets their base stats.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:**
    1.  Select a character (Kaelen, Aris, or Lena).
* **OUTCOME:** Base stats are set. The player is now in control and can explore the room. Leads to Scene 3.

---

### **SCENE 3: THE FIRST ROOM**

* **LOCATION:** Ruined Maintenance Bay.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, The AI.
* **SUMMARY:** The player explores the starting room, which contains a rusted locker and a patch of Glimmer Moss. This scene serves as a tutorial for basic skill checks and resource gathering.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:**
    1.  **Investigate the Locker:** A skill check is required (Strength to force, Agility to pick, or Intelligence to hotwire).
    2.  **Investigate the Moss:** A skill check is required (Perception to notice details, Aris's Bio-Scan for full analysis).
    3.  **Query the AI:** Interact with the AI for more lore/context.
    4.  **Leave the room.**
* **OUTCOME:** The player potentially gains their first resources (**Degraded Power Cell**, **Glimmer Moss Sample**). After exploring, they proceed through the collapsed doorway. Leads to Scene 4.

---

### **SCENE 4: THE FIRST OBSTACLE**

* **LOCATION:** A collapsed transit tunnel connecting the Maintenance Bay to the Plaza.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player.
* **SUMMARY:** To reach the plaza, the player must navigate a short but unstable tunnel. The floor is a mess of twisted metal and rubble, and the ceiling groans under the strain. This is a mandatory challenge to proceed.
* **PLAYER CHOICE (All characters see all options):**
    1.  **[BRUTE FORCE]:** Shove a large piece of debris to create a stable, direct path.
    2.  **[ANALYZE]:** Scan the structure for the most stable route and reinforce a weak point with scrap metal.
    3.  **[NAVIGATE]:** Nimbly climb and weave through the most dangerous, but quickest, path.
* **OUTCOME:**
    * **SUCCESS (Choosing the correct option for your character):**
        * If you are **Kaelen** and choose **[BRUTE FORCE]**...
        * If you are **Aris** and choose **[ANALYZE]**...
        * If you are **Lena** and choose **[NAVIGATE]**...
        * ...you succeed. You use your natural talents to pass through the tunnel unharmed, all attributes intact.
    * **FAILURE (Choosing the incorrect option for your character):**
        * If you are Kaelen and choose to Analyze, or Lena and choose Brute Force, etc...
        * ...your attempt is clumsy and ill-suited to your skills. A piece of rubble gives way, and you get through, but you are injured or exhausted. You receive a temporary debuff or a minor permanent reduction (e.g., -1) to the attribute you tried to use (Strength for Brute Force, Intelligence for Analyze, or Agility for Navigate). This will make the skill check in Scene 5A more difficult.
    * Leads to Scene 5.

### **SCENE 5: THE CROSSROADS & THE ANNOUNCEMENT**

* **LOCATION:** A ruined city plaza outside the transit tunnel.
* **CHARACTERS:** The Player, The Proctor (voice).
* **SUMMARY:** The player emerges into a larger area with two clear paths. A high-Perception character may notice tracks. The Proctor's booming voice announces the **Major Event: The Drop**, a time-limited supply cache landing in the plaza.
* **PLAYER CHOICE:**
    1.  **Go for the Supply Drop:** Head towards the contested location.
    2.  **Ignore the Drop:** Choose a path (rooftops or subway) to avoid the conflict.
* **OUTCOME:** Leads to either **Scene 5A** (Go for Drop) or **Scene 6** (Ignore Drop).

* **PLAYER CHOICE:**
    1.  **Direct Confrontation (Skill Check):** Challenge the Rival. The check will be harder if the player failed in Scene 4.
    2.  **Create a Diversion.**
    3.  **Observe and Withdraw.**
