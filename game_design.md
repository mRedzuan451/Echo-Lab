Game Design Document: Echo Lab1. Core Concept & ThemeGenre: Text-Based Survival RPGLogline: Contestants kidnapped for a brutal, galaxy-spanning game must survive a shattered world controlled by cold, calculating alien researchers. Using their unique skills, they must outwit rivals, outlast engineered disasters, and uncover the dark purpose of the deadly experiment they're trapped in.Theme: The game is a dark sci-fi survival story where the central conflict is not just about Man vs. Nature, but about Order vs. Chaos, Strength vs. Intellect, and Humanity vs. Indifference.2. The Setting: The Echo LabMasterminds: The Archivists: An ancient, hyper-logical alien race obsessed with finding the "strongest" species to inherit their legacy. They see the game not as entertainment, but as a series of cold, scientific trials. The entire experiment is overseen by their detached AI, "The Proctor."Venue: The Shattered World: The game takes place on a planet that was destroyed in a past experiment. It is now a collection of floating islands, a graveyard filled with the ruins of a lost civilization, teeming with imported alien life.The Ruined City-Isle: Crumbling skyscrapers draped in alien vines form a vertical jungle. Rusting transit tubes and collapsed highways create treacherous pathways between districts. Landmarks include the flooded Grand Concourse, the silent Corporate Citadel, and the precarious Habitation Spires. Threats include territorial, pack-hunting creatures that have made nests in the ruins and automated security drones from the old civilization that still patrol their routes.The Deep-Forest Shard: A massive chunk of what was once a wild continent. It's a bioluminescent jungle of towering, pulsating flora and strange fauna. Locations range from the boggy, spore-choked Lowlands to the high-altitude nests of winged predators in the Canopy. The forest itself is a hazard, with carnivorous plants and hallucinogenic pollen.The Exposed Core: The final, most dangerous cluster of islands, floating around the planet's still-glowing, radioactive heart. The environment is a twisted landscape of obsidian glass and radioactive crystals. Life here is mutated and hyper-aggressive. Survival requires specialized gear to resist the constant radiation.Mechanic: Test Chambers: Within the permanent ruined landscape, the Archivists have installed adaptive, hard-light zones. These "chambers" can reconfigure on command to create controlled experiments like shifting mazes, holographic combat simulations, or environmental puzzles.3. Playable Characters & RivalsEach character has a unique skillset, resource abilities, and a dedicated rival who acts as their dark mirror.Kaelen "Rook" Vance (The Soldier)Description: Broad-shouldered and scarred, Kaelen carries himself with the rigid posture of a soldier. His eyes are constantly scanning, assessing threats.Quote: "Trust gets you killed. A loaded weapon gets you through the night."Rival: Xander "Vulture" Kade: A tall, lean man with a cruel smile and eyes that lack any warmth. He sees people as pawns. Quote: "Rules are for the people who lack the will to break them."Dr. Aris Thorne (The Bio-Hacker)Description: Wiry and intense, with restless hands and eyes that see the world as a series of interconnected puzzles. He is more comfortable with alien flora than with people.Quote: "Everything is a system. You just have to find the variables, the inputs, and the outputs. Even survival is just an equation."Rival: Jinx: A whirlwind of chaotic energy, with brightly colored hair, a manic grin, and clothes covered in grease stains and scorch marks. Quote: "A plan is just a list of things that are about to go wrong. I prefer improvisation."Lena "Ghost" Petrova (The Infiltrator)Description: Lithe and athletic, Lena moves with a silent grace. She is a master of blending into the background, her expression a neutral mask that betrays nothing.Quote: "The best way to win a fight is to make sure your opponent never knew you were there."Rival: Isha "Hawkeye": Patient and powerfully built, with eyes that seem to miss nothing. She is adorned with trophies from her hunts. Quote: "The silence doesn't mean you're alone. It just means I haven't let you hear me yet."4. Gameplay Loop & ProgressionStructure: The game is divided into "levels," with each level being a large island or cluster of islands.Progression System: To advance, players must find and activate "Archive Gates."Core Loop:Survive & Explore the current island.Collect 3 Data Fragments by completing Test Chambers, defeating the island's Apex Predator, and finding historical data from the ruins.Locate & Activate the hidden Archive Gate to ascend to the next, more dangerous level.5. Resources & CraftingResources are divided into categories, each with a risk/reward balance.Organic: Harvested from the natural environment (e.g., Glimmer Moss for light/healing, which also attracts predators).Synthetic: Salvaged from ruins (e.g., Degraded Power Cells for a power boost, with a risk of stunning you).Exotic: High-risk, high-reward materials from dangerous areas (e.g., Resonant Crystal Shards for endgame gear, which are radioactive to carry).6. Key Mechanics & Event TypesMajor Events: Large-scale, scripted events that push the story forward.The Drop: The game's opening. Contestants are scattered across the first island with a single objective: a high-tier supply cache is dropping in a central, contested location, forcing an immediate risk/reward decision.The Arena Shift: A mid-game event where the Proctor triggers a massive environmental disaster (like a flood or wildfire) to flush survivors from their shelters and force them into a new, dangerous migration.The Apex Hunt: The Proctor releases an engineered "champion" predator onto an island, a relentless biomechanical hunter designed to raise the stakes and eliminate contestants.Test Chamber Examples:The Shifting Maze: A plaza reconfigures into a labyrinth of hard-light walls, testing spatial reasoning under a time limit.The Holographic Hunt: A clearing floods with a mix of real and holographic creatures, testing perception and threat response.Branching Choices & Game Overs: Small, dynamic events will present choices that can lead to an immediate GAME OVER if the player isn't careful or fails a skill check (e.g., "The Moral Test" where an act of mercy is a trap).Skill Thresholds: Progression is blocked by major environmental events that require a minimum stat level or a specific crafted item to survive, making character development essential.Character Interactions: Scripted events where playable characters meet, forcing the player to choose between cooperation (leading to a stat boost), rivalry (creating a persistent enemy), or deception (gaining a prize at a heavy cost).7. Endgame & Story ConclusionThe Final Exam: The NexusThe game's climax takes place in The Nexus, the sterile, white command center of the Echo Lab. Here, the player confronts the Proctor directly. The final test is "Synthesis," an offer to have the survivor's consciousness uploaded and preserved in the Archivists' data core. The player's primary rival arrives, forcing a final confrontation where only one can "win."The Three EndingsThe player's final choice in the Nexus determines the outcome of the game.1. The "Strength" Ending (The Archivists' Way): The player accepts the test, defeats their rival, and is "synthesized." They win the game by the Archivists' rules, achieving a cold, hollow victory as their consciousness is preserved but their body is left an empty shell.2. The "Cooperation" Ending (The Human Way): The player rejects the test and convinces their rival to form an alliance against their common enemy. Together, they fight through the Nexus's defenses, overload the system, and escape as the Echo Lab is destroyed. This ending champions humanity's strength in unity.3. The "Sabotage" Ending (The Renegade Way): The player rejects both the test and their rival, deciding the entire system must be destroyed. This leads to a three-way battle that, if successful, destroys the lab and all its data, marking humanity as a chaotic threat to be purged by the Archivists.Sequel Hook: The Unintended ConsequenceChoosing the "Cooperation" ending unlocks a special epilogue. Upon escaping, the players discover their sabotage didn't just destroy a labâ€”it decapitated the entire, rigidly interconnected Archivist empire.A New War: The collapse of the Archivists creates a massive power vacuum, plunging the galaxy into war.The Hunted: As the only known beings to have defeated the Archivists, the player and their rival become the most valuable and most hunted individuals in this new, chaotic universe, setting the stage for a sequel.
